# ðŸŽ§ **Spotify Playlist Optimization**
### *Enhancing User Engagement Through Multi-Objective Optimization*

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**
This project focuses on optimizing Spotify playlists using a **multi-objective optimization model** to balance user satisfaction, song popularity, and diversity. By leveraging **mathematical programming** and **user preference data**, the model curates playlists that:
1. Align with individual listening habits.
2. Promote inclusivity with gender and genre diversity constraints.
3. Maximize engagement and user satisfaction.

The goal is to demonstrate how optimization techniques can enhance the music-streaming experience while supporting Spotify's business objectives, such as user retention and sustainability.

For a detailed explanation of the methodology, constraints, and results, please refer to the full **documentation** provided in the repository.
